# LU_Decomposition
Theoretical project on very common matrix decomposition technique, called LU Decomposition.

# Short introduction
This project is theoretical introduction to one very important approach in matrices decomposition in Linear Algebra, called LU Decomposition. In this project you can see all the 
theorems and lemmas, used to construct the idea of LU Decomposition from scratch. You can also see some applications of the method in real world context. In the last section you
can see one very simple example of applying the method in Cryptography. In order to understand the concepts in this project i assume, that you have basic knowledge of Linear Algebra
like matrix arithmetics, linear transformations, inverse matrices, determinants, linear equations and systems of equations.
